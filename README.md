# DEXtrading
### Just some ideas I'm putting down before coding

* #### p2p:
  * Hubs listing peers: Anyone can host these.
  * Peers connect to hub and gets an id
  * Peers can connect to other peers via ids by querying the hub which ip has the id

* #### Trade:
  * TBD
  
  
* #### Langauge:
  * Python and NodeJS are good options, I really want to do a project in Go though.
